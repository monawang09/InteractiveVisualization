Each of the houses have different benefits. Please call for details. I will try to match you with the house that fits your needs, and the roommates that fit your style.\nRight now we're offering 3 specials.\nThe regular rent is $5500, but you can get $1000 off for sharing with 1 absent roommate(currently only visits 2 days every other month). \nAlso, get $400 off per month just paying on time, and for maintaining the house well for every month of the year.\nLastly, we have various forms of early move-in options.\nBefore we waste time…\nDo you have weirdness? We may still rent to you. Just let us know upfront. Examples...\nDo you have multiple people for one room? Do you have pets? Do you have weird pets? Do you have multiple vehicles that you're trying to bring to a multi person house? Are you asking for a deferred payment? Are you asking for work trade? Do you absolutely have to hang a naked picture of Joe Biden on the living room wall?\nOK, that last one is really a decision that your roommates will have to approve. I really couldn't care less.\nThe point is, I try not to disqualify anyone for these sorts of things. But I do need to know in order to fit a group together that will get along. I.e. Only one of the houses is OK with dogs. Only one of the houses has an inconvenience discount. Only one of the houses has a flexible room discount. Neither house accepts smokers. Only one of the houses has a double occupancy option in one of the rooms. Only one of the houses is OK with undergrads. Etc.\nAlso note: if you have NONE of these issues, that's great. Your application process will be faster and easier.\nThe rooms range from 90 ft.² to 240 ft.² Each house has been completely remodeled, and has several additional benefits above and beyond standard amenities. \nFurniture available. Furniture use is free, But you are responsible for damage.\nNote: I also have larger houses in Davis\nWoodland house:\n5 bedroom house\nNewly remodeled \nNew appliances\nNew a/c, furnace\nEfficient Woodstove(firewood available for free)\nHigh efficiency windows, fixtures, etc. Additional insulation recently added\n4+ off street parking spaces\n2+ on street spaces\nEthernet/cable routed to each room\nListed prices are monthly; length of lease is yearly.\nTahoe vacation rentals available for free.(for ski trips, parties, etc.)\ncareered individuals preferred(Grad students ok) \nNo application fee as long as tenants commit to renting the house.

It is a fantastic two-story townhouse on the second/third floor facing the UCD Crops, Olive Lane, Bee Sanctuary, and the Yolo County Airport. The Unitrans Bus stop is only yards away from the property and can connect you to all of Davis and the larger region. Public transportation in Davis and Yolo is terrific!\nhttps://www.stonegatevillageapt.com\nTreehouse living with amazing views and all the amenities of one of the best properties in Davis has the wonderful Stonegate Country Club membership for everyone on the unit lease for only $50 a month.  (XL heated pool, allowing year-round swimming :)\nhttps://stonegatecc.com/\nStonegate Village is in such high demand,  with a high % of the residents being Grad Vet students, only 1 1/2 miles from UCD Campus... that they don't pay to advertise the property, so won't see on a lot of Davis or Yolo rental listings\nI hadn't planned on leaving, but a dream job came my way, I have loved living here for the last 8 years.. It's super hard to give up; like living in the country but still in Davis.\nIf you can move in July or August, you can apply for a lease takeover, which will give you my rate of 2120 instead of 2650. This rate will be until August 2025, when it will increase only a % compared to new tenants.  If you are willing to take the place \"As Is\" (meaning no new paint or new flooring), you won't need to put down the 1500 deposit. I will transfer my deposit to your account and since I have lived there over 5 years, there won't be paint or flooring fees when you move out.\nThe bedrooms on the third floor are very large, and for many years, one of them was divided into two smaller rooms with double bunk beds in both. The other one has a large loft, and I have a large library of books in this space. It is also large enough for two beds but not currently set up that way.  If someone really loves the lofts or bunkbeds, might be willing to sell or work something out since we are not 100% on our new living space.\nWest Manner Park is right across the street from the complex. It has tennis courts, a play structure, a large activity field, and a preschool. The Davis Bike Path, which loops the entire town, is also right across from the complex. Both Patwin Elementary School and Emerson Junior High School are within biking/walking distance. Both my kids ride or scooter to school independently on the bike path. It's a very safe neighborhood.\nI am still working out my move plans; I just signed my new contract this morning. :) But I wanted to get this out there right away. I know how hard it is for a family to find an affordable place in Davis; being so much under the market rate should help you get settled in your new community.\nIf interested please email.  Since this is still a private residence, I will send pictures to only those serious about moving in.\n    ",
